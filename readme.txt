== FAQ ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin helps you embed forms created with [Paperform](https://paperform.co?utm_source=wordpress_plugin). It provides a block for embedding forms via the Gutenberg editor, along with a shortcode for embedding Paperform forms "[paperform id=my-form-id]".

= How do I use the Paperform block? =

It's easy! Just follow the following steps.

1) Insert the Paperform block
Either choose Paperform from under the embed section in the block menu, or type `/paperform` on a new line inside the Gutenberg editor.

2) Copy and paste the form URL into the form URL box
If you don't have a form yet, you can create it at [Paperform.co](https://paperform.co/?utm_source=wordpress_plugin).

3) Your done! But you can configure more stuff if you want.

There are some other options available in the block widget:

- Use a popup button
- Turn on lazy loading (so the form only loads when it comes on screen)
- Show a spinner while the form is loading
- Disable automatic scrolling, or set an offset to account for fixed navigation bars on your site.

Save the post and check out your handy work.

= How do I use the Paperform shortcode? =

Simple! Anywhere you can use a shortcode, simply type `[paperform my-form-name]` where "my-form-name" is part of the form URL before paperform.co. For example, if your form's direct URL is https://newsletter.paperform.co, then the form's ID would be "newsletter". E.g. [paperform newsletter].

Want to configure the embed? The embed supports a bunch of attributes to change the way the embed behaves. See https://paperform.co/help/articles/embed-forms for a full list of supported attributes. To add attributes to your shortcode, you can just add them before the closing "]".

For example, [paperform newsletter lazy=1 no-scroll=1].

= Can I use the Paperform shortcode to embed a popup button? =

Yes! Follow the shortcode instructions above to embed the form, and then you can add the following additional attributes to turn it into a popup button.

** popup-button **
This will turn the embed into a button, that when clicked will open the form.

** label **
This will be the text displayed on the button

** class **
Any additional CSS classes you would like to add to the form.

For example, `[paperform newsletter popup-button=1 label="Show me the form please" class="btn-default btn-lg"]`

= Do I need a Paperform account? =

Yes, you can sign up for paperform at [Paperform.co](https://paperform.co/register?utm_source=wordpress_plugin).

= Can I create forms directly from this plugin? =

No, not at this time.
